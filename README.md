All you need to do is double click on the jar file to run it. You may get an error message about an executable bit, or that it the file is not set as executable.  To solve this you can right click on the file and go to properties.  From there go to permissions and then click the "Allow executing file a program" box.  This will allow the os to run the file by double clicking. 
                                                                          
If when you double click the file, an archive appears with a file directory and all of the files, right click the file, and hover over "Open With".  Then select whichever is closest to Java Runtime.  If such does not appear, select "Other Application" under "Open With" and look for Java manually.  If you cannot find anyhting even remotely java ted, you will likely need to install java.  To make sure you can open a terminal and type the command "java -version" and there should be a result that reads something along the lines of "OpenJdk Runtime Environment" with a version number.  If any error occurs in that process you need install java.                                                       
                  
These methods were tested with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and should work other similar operating systems.  The methods will likely be different between different distributions and flavours, and may be nothing alike what is above for some of the more strange distros, such as Tiny Core.

All you need to do is double click on the jar file to run it. You may get an error message about the file not being safe to run. This is because Apple goes to great extremes for security which includes only allowing applications from trusted developers to be run.  This is to make sure all applications run by the user are virus free and safe.  

However, this has the effect of independent developers like myself having a hard time to be write applications  
for Apples operating systems.  In order to become trusted I would need to jump through a number of hoops, only use packages from other trusted sources internally, and pay a fee.  As a broke student doing this for fun, I'm not willing to shell out the coin.  I'm not even paying for a domain name ffs.  Anyways, the solution is actually pretty simple.  If you attempt to run an application and get denied you should A) look up whether the app is actually safe.  There are plenty of forums online for this. And B) after determining the application is safe, go to the Apple Menu -> System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> General -> Then under the "Allow Applications from:" select "Anywhere". I believe if you have attempted to run the application recently there should be an option for allowing this application to run which you should prefer.  Generally you should keep the security setting as is so you don't accidentally run something that could harm you computer or worse.     

This application needs Java to run.  If you can't run it, and the above doesn't work, make sure java is installed on your I'm not sure how to do that on mac, without using the terminal but you can open the terminal under Utilities in the Finder and then type java -version /probably/.      

This method is currently untested as I do not have access to a Mac based machine.

All you need to do is double-click the jar file to run it. For aesthetic purposes I have used a wrapper to give a cute lil' icon to the jar file, and set it as an .exe file.  This is likely all meaningless to you so double-click that guy and have fun. The User Account Control Dialog may pop up to demand admin access. All you need to do is say "What the fuck, I am the administrator" and click "Yes".  Unless of course you aren't the administrator, in which case you should probably get your parents permission and have them type in their password and click the ol' yes box.         
    
Your first time running may take a little long and you may get a small window from your anti-virus saying "Slow down there bucko' this here program may have a virus or two kicking around in that bad boy" and do a quick check, and cross-reference.  At this point you should say "What the heck?  I trust Holden with my life", email 
me your credit card number, your pin, and the 3 digit cvv on the back (please don't ever actually do that).  When the anti-virus finishes its check it'll be like "Yup, wowie, this cat was wrong about this program you tried to run, daddio" and will let you finally use the application.  Say "thank you Lord and Saviour "Wayne Gretzky" and begin to look up your exam dates. 
                                                            
These methods were tested on the virtual box in my head running windows 7 Home Premium.  I can't be certain if the methods will work for all anti-virus systems, as they're all different, nor can I be certain it'll run if you don't say all of the dialog I've included in the directions.  You should probably say it all in a very culty, monotone voice in the UFV library at 9:55 pm every Wednesday just to be safe.  Sorry.  I don't make the rules.         
    
This program needs java installed to run.  You can check it by...   I dunno, summoning the archangel Raphael and being like "Raph, does this PC have java installed on it" and because the role of Raphael (it's more of a title than anything else) was actually taken over by John Von Neumann in the 1963, 6 years after his death, he'll say something akin to "Was zum Teufel ist Java?" which roughly translates from German into "What the heck is Java"   
since Von Neumann died in 1957, and Java came out in 1995.
    
After you've summoned John Von Neumann, you can go to the start menu on your windows device, and type "CMD", then type "java -version to see what your java version is.  If you don't got it, everything will hit the fan, a fissure will open up and take the eldest born child in the latest generation of your immediate family to feed John Von Veumann. 10% of that goes to keeping Keith Richards alive.  Charitable cause, I say.  The selected child is often a sibling, or a cousin, but sometimes a niece, nephew or non-binary child born to one of your siblings.  This, however, does not affect non-blood relatives, so all adopted children are safe.  Under the circumstances that your younger sibling ran the command above without having Java installed on the computer, and you are adopted, kindly lean over to, call, or fedex a message to, your non-blood sibling, and rub it in their face.                        

This error occurs in about 6% of devices, so it tends to be pretty  
common at an alpha level = 0.05
